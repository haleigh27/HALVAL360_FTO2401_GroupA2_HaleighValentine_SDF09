Project overview:

This project focused on the use of Tailwind CSS to accurately recreate a responsive footer based on a reference image.

Learning reflections:

-I could use Tailwind CSS to effectively style the footer with the help of the Tailwind CSS documentation on the official website.
-Determining the exact sizing of the components and text from the reference image was challenging at times.
-Determining exactly where to add aria-labels was also confusing as all components were aready desrciptive when using a screen-reader.Aria-labels were however added to headings and links to help with accessibility.
